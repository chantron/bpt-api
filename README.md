# Brown Paper Tickets PHP API Wrapper
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/brownpapertickets/BptAPI.php.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/brownpapertickets/BptAPI.php)

The BptAPI library consists of a set of classes that enable you to easily interact with the [Brown Paper Tickets API](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/apidocs/index.html).

Since this library is still in early development, method names will possibly change.
See CHANGELOG for more information on any breaking changes.

## Usage

After installing the library (either through composer or by dropping the files into your own project), you'll want to first initialize the class that contains the methods you want to use. Everytime you intialize a class, you need to pass in your Brown Paper Tickets Developer ID.

For Example, to get a listing of events under a specific account, you'd use the [EventInfo](#eventinfo) class.

```php
$eventInfo = new EventInfo('Your Developer ID');
```

That will give you access to all of that class' methods.

To obtain an array containing all of the producer's events, we'd invoke the `getEvents` method. The get events method takes a total of four arguments:

| Arguments | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `$username` | String  | No | The event producer whos events you wish to get |
| `$eventID`  | Integer | No | An Event ID if you want to get info on a particular Event |
| `$getDates` | Boolean | No | Pass `true` if you want to get a list of dates belonging to the event. Defaults to `false`|
| `$getPrices`| Boolean | No | Pass `true` if you want to get a list of prices belogning to each Date. Defaults to `false`|

```php
$events = $eventInfo->getEvents('some user name' null, true, true);
 ```
This would return an associative array with all of the event info along with dates and prices:

```php

        [fullDescription] => This is the full description. Much fuller! Lots more to say! OMG!

Use the Full Description to describe your event as completely as possible. It's common to list performers or presenters along with a short bio for each. Additional details, such as a description of the expected activities, help create interest for potential attendees and can greatly increase attendance. This is your chance to create a verbal picture of your event!

## Changelog

* 8.4.2014 - Cast sales info to proper data types. Added sales test.
* 6.3.2014 - Cleaned up some of the tests.
* Fixed some variable name typos. Fixed issue with dates/prices being wrapped in an array when it is already being returned as an array.
* April 14, 2014: Intitial commit. Due to error, this commit is gone. At this point, most endpoints have been added. Unit test coverages is about 60% I'd say.
